It handles typos, various spelling sequences, synonyms and prioritized options.\nThe technically correct term for this would be something like an “auto-complete text field with loose partial matching, synonyms and weighted results.” That’s a bit long, so I’ve simply dubbed it the “Redesigned Country Selector”.\n\n- Read the article Redesigning The Country Selector by Christian Holst from Smashing Magazine\nhttp://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/10/redesigning-the-country-selector/\n\n- Try the demo\nhttp://baymard.com/labs/country-selector\n\n##Usage\n\nYou can use this package on the client side, as a jQuery plugin, or on the server side, as a Node.js package.\n\nOn the client side it modifies the default select widget. On the server side it generates HTML for the complete exhaustive country list compatible with the requirements of the client, including specialized attributes. \n\nIn addition to this package you'll need jQuery, a jquery autocomplete plugin, and CSS to style the HTML for the country selector. See sample.html to get started. You might also find test.nodjs.countryList.js a helpful example.\n\nTo use on the server side do 'npm install nodejs.countrylist.js'. Then in your node module:\n\n````\nvar lib = require(\"./nodejs.countryList.js\");\nvar defaultCountry = 'Vanuatu';\nvar cl = lib.countryList(defaultCountry);\n// insert the HTML you have generated into your template\nres.render('template.html', { placeholderInHTML: cl } ); \n````\n\n\n",
